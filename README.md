# The Crypto Clubhouse
A NFL themed website that features sign up and login using a MySQL database to store usernames and passwords. The user will select their preferred NFL team and will be automatically sent to that team's page. They can also browse all 37 teams pages that use MySportsFeeds API and NewsApi to display updated division standing, game match ups and scroes, and team roster. There is a chat page that also uses a MySQL database for those signed in to send chats and respond to specific posts.
